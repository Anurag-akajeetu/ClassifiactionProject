# ClassifiactionProject
Classifying a patient for a particular disease based on the symptom the present presents a simple binary classification problem. But the degree of complexity of simple problem is aggravated in the medical settings as particular symptom, sometimes proves futile to efficiently lead to a successful classification, may correspond to multiple diseases. The key arsenal against this particular drawback is to use multiple symptoms or attributes that presents a clear definition of the disease. With this motivation, we present a hybrid-01-classifier to classify a patient, based on 19 features, for a particular disease.
